Some Prerequisites needed:

- Python >3.1
- SeleniumWebdriver (cannot be run without a window manager yet) 
- BeautifulSoup4
- Celery
- Geocoder
- Firefox
- Redis

Using MullVad vpn to rotate IPs right now so, unless you've got that, you'll need to remove the os.system call in task_manager (line  52)

Currently set up to work with celery. You'll need to 1) fire up a redis-cli instance on local machine.

2) Navigate to code directory and run "celery -A amazon_search_light worker --concurrency=4 --loglevel=info"

3) Then fire up the Task Manager and it should start distributing tasks, "python task_manager.py"

Alternatively, 1) just remove the celery notation (lines 484-488) from amazon_search_light.py 

2) set search_term (in def scraping_task("whatever_you_like") for a single scrape. 

Let me know if you have any problems or find any bugs!
